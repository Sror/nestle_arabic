    <div style="width:80%;"><p>How will my young child grow in weight and height now that he is 3 years old?</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont">Young children do not grow as fast as babies and toddlers. Don’t worry if your previously chubby two-year old is turning into a slimmer and straighter five-year old. The plumpness of the baby fat will be replaced by that of strong and healthy muscles as he starts to engage in regular sports activities by 4 or 5. As long as weight and height rise together, growth will be proceeding normally. Three year olds will probably gain around 2.3kg and 9cm; dropping to 2kg and 6.5cm during the fifth year. These are approximate figures only, and remember that every child is unique in his development and growth. Your child’s pediatrician will surely monitor his growth during the routine check-ups, but don’t think twice before checking with the doctor if you have concerns with regards to your child’s growth at any point in time.

    <div class="acc_cont">A light snack will not only satisfy your child’s hunger, but also provide him with the energy and nutrients he needs to continue his activities, as well as improving his ability to learn, concentration on his tasks or his performance in sports. <h5>Here are some tips:</h5>
   <blockquote> <ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:normal"><li>
Plan his daily menus ahead of time, this way you can prepare the snacks based on whatever your child is having as main meals and fill in the gap; Macaroni and Cheese for lunch? Turkey Sandwich for dinner? Make sure to offer his 5-a-day fruits and veggies as snacks.</li><br/>
<li>Offer light Snacks that come in a small portion, 2 hours away from main meals, so that your child is still hungry when its lunch or dinner time.</li><br/>
<li>Try offering home-made snacks rather than ready convenience foods that may be too high in Sugar, Salt and or unhealthy Fats such as chips and candy. Home-made Low-fat fruit cake, fruit custard or Mini Oat biscuits make a nice change.</li> <br/>
<li>Always have some ready-to-eat fruits and vegetables sticks in the fridge for a snack on the go; or for your child to grab if they feel hungry between meals.</li><br/>
<li>Watch the sweetened juices and carbonated beverages as these drinks can replace milk which is still at the core of preschoolers’ diets.

    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont">4 to 5 year olds are extremely influenced by what their friends are eating, and trying to keep children as healthy as possible is challenge nowadays. <h5>Here are a few tips:</h5>
     <blockquote> <ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:normal">
<li>Limit the time where your child is watching TV</li><br/>
<li>Encourage your child to be physically active everyday</li><br/>
<li>Be aware of what your child is eating at home, in preschool, in play groups and birthdays and encourage him to develop healthy eating habits. Talk about what he will be eating wherever he is going.</li><br/>
<li>Keep your own home as healthy as possible</li><br/>
<li>Stock up on healthier choices lower in fats, salt and sugar and always have ready washed fruits and veggies within reach.</li>

    <div class="acc_cont">How to get your child ready to eat alone, outside of the house and to make sure his lunchbox doesn’t come back half-full? 
     <blockquote> <ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:normal">
<li>Ask ahead of time what time are morning snack and lunch offered and try to put your child on the new schedule at home 2 weeks before going to preschool</li><br/>
<li>Start by putting in the lunchbox the foods that your young one generally likes and does not make a fuss to eat at home</li><br/>
<li>Prepare a small and light morning Snack so that he will be hungry enough at lunch-time</li><br/>
<li>Make the snack something easy to eat such as a mini bagel, sandwich, vegetables sticks or a fruit</li><br/>
<li>Never miss the opportunity of gathering the entire family for meals where you can be a role model by respecting table manners and of course enjoying new foods together.</li><br/>
<li>Give him the chance to eat alone using utensils just like you.</li><br/>
</ul></blockquote>
Don’t worry! Very soon, you will realize that he will eat more foods and more neatly when he is with his friends than he is at home. Imitation of peers is a very powerful tool as you may know, so raise your expectations when it comes to your young one feeding himself alone and like an adult.

    <div class="acc_cont">Young childhood is the time where your little one is eager to learn everything that passes in front of their eyes, and learns a big deal from imitating his parents. <h5>So be a positive role model and follow good nutrition habits by:</h5>
     <blockquote> <ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:normal">

    <div style="width:80%;"><p>My child refuses to eat anything in the morning. Is it alright if he misses on breakfast?

</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont">Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, it offers the brain the energy it needs after a long night of fast, it plays a vital role in enhancing your child’s physical and mental performance, as well as their ability to learn at school. It is also important for overall nutrition, children who miss it, won’t catch up on those essential nutrients during the rest of the day!
<h5>How to make your child enjoy having breakfast?</h5>
<blockquote> <ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:normal">
<li>As a role model, never skip breakfast, gather the family together and make it fun & yummy! (A smoothie, a muffin, pancakes or fruit-filled crepes maybe?)</li><br/>
<li>Talk to your child about the benefits of breakfast, especially when it makes him stronger and smarter!</li><br/>
<li>If “I’m not hungry” is the excuse for skipping breakfast, offer a milkshake or smoothie. Just blend your child’s favorite flavor or fruit with a cup of specialized growing-up milk. This is one way to start his day with Vitamins, minerals and fiber!</li><br/>
<li>Allow him to eat on his way to school. Try a banana or some whole-grain cereals</li><br/>
<li>Wake your child up 10 minutes earlier, to allow some time for breakfast</li><br/>

    <div style="width:80%;"><p>Ever since my child joined school, he stopped drinking milk! How can it affect my child? 

</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont">After a certain age, some kids start to reduce their milk intake or stop drinking it completely. By doing this, it will expose them to loss in bone density which can cause osteoporosis later on in life. 25% of children who avoid milk are prone to bone fractures before the age of 8, with most of them caused by small trips or falls. So milk is still very important for your child as it will continue to build his bones all through his childhood and maintain strong bones in the future.<br/>
Drinking milk will also balance his diet; as part of a healthy and balanced diet, it is recommended that children consume 2-3 servings of milk and dairy per day. Avoiding milk in particular, could reduce your child’s chances of meeting his nutritional needs for proteins, Calcium, Phosphorus and other essential nutrients.<br/>
Therefore, encourage your kid to drink 2 glasses of specialized growing-up milk per day and stop him from drinking carbonated beverages or other sugary drinks that are poor in nutrients and could replace milk in his diet.

<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p>My child doesn’t accept new foods, and I am worried that his diet might not be varied enough.
 

</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont">Many children go through phases when they are picky eaters, and might get only a minimum amount of the required nutrients, vitamins and minerals from the foods they eat. If your child chooses certain foods over others, then your child is merely a fussy eater, which is normal at this age and just a temporary phase. So there’s no need to worry.<br/>
Most of the nutrients that children need are available in a variety of foods like milk, dairy products, fresh coloured vegetables, meats, fruits, whole grain cereals and bread, legumes and eggs. By eating whole foods (fresh vegetables, fresh fruit, whole grains, etc.), your child can get the necessary nutrients in the healthiest possible way. And even if your child is not eating well, just offer him an alternative from the same food group, and make sure he is drinking specialized growing-up milk in order to help meet his daily needs of nutrients, calories, vitamins and minerals. <br/>
Remember, preschoolers are often picky eaters. But as they grow older, their taste for food changes and over time they should begin to eat a more varied diet. So you may want to be creative in adding whole foods to your child's diet and make his eating experience as pleasant as possible, because only a varied nutrition will help him grow strong and healthy.

<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p>Do I have to give my child vitamin and mineral supplements?


</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont">
    Preschoolers need a range of vitamins and minerals to grow healthy and strong. Is he having a variety of foods from all 5 food groups? Does he like wholegrain? Is he having his 5 servings of fruits and vegetables daily? A serving can be roughly equivalent to your child’s fist. Are you offering balanced meals that include lean meat, fish, legumes, pulses or eggs daily? Does he drink 2 cups of milk daily? If your answer is “definitely yes” to all of the questions above, then rest assured, your child is healthy and is most likely to be having his daily requirements of most of the vitamins and minerals. <br/>
The issue is usually with picky eaters who reject their colorful fruits & vegetables rich in Vitamin A & C (carrots, broccoli, spinach, oranges, kiwi), do not accept meat (rich in Iron and Zinc), and are hard to be persuaded to try new foods. Picky eating is common among preschoolers. <br/>
However, if your child is having 500ml of specialized Growing-up milk daily, he is more likely to meet his requirements for many of the vitamins and minerals and that’s because these are added to the milk and in quantities needed by children aged 3 to 5 years.
To help you decide whether your child needs Vitamin supplementation, talk to your pediatrician about his eating habits, weight and growth pattern.

    <div style="width:80%;"><p>My child’s pediatrician said he is overweight. What steps should I follow to help him? Is putting him on a diet alright at his age?



</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont">
    The causes behind children gaining excessive weight nowadays are closely related to the quality of their diet as well as to how active they are. Children are either eating above their need, or, consuming foods that are not necessarily nutritious but rather high in calories, in fat and sugar like chips, sweets and Fast food.  Children as well are more likely to be playing video games than engaging in active play. <br/>
Putting young children on a strict diet is not recommended. What experts usually look for when a child is overweight is for him to grow in height while maintaining the same weight and this way he will be balancing out his weight to height ratio.
 
<h5>Follow these tips to help your child: </h5>
<blockquote> <ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:normal">
<li><strong>Get moving</strong>: Incorporate physical activity into your child’s everyday life, like: walking, playing with mates outdoors and encourage him to commit to a sport routine he likes.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Encourage your child to eat right</strong>: Cut down on unhealthy snacks that have lots of calories, fat and sugar, such as chips, ice cream, cakes and biscuits. Avoid fast food. A healthy and balanced diet incorporating all the food groups – milk and dairy, breads and cereals, fruits, vegetables, and meats and legumes – will provide your child with all the calories he needs for healthy growth.</li><br/>
<li>Serve your child small meals and if he still hungry you can add a little more, rather than getting him used to a large portion.</li><br/>
<li>Limit the time watching TV or sitting in front of the computer to no more than two hours a day; spend more family time doing activities such as swimming and playing fun games.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Consult an expert:</strong> Consult a dietitian to know more about healthy eating.</li></ul></blockquote>

<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p>My child rejects all kinds of fruits, so I try to make up for this by offering juices which he loves. Is this healthy?</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont">
    Children just love juices! Offering natural unsweetened fruit juice, especially the freshly squeezed one that is rich in vitamins and minerals, is particularly beneficial for children who don’t eat enough vegetables and fruits.  However, juices should only be given in moderation:
    <blockquote> <ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:normal">
<li>Juices even if fresh or 100% natural lose the fiber present in the pulp that is essential for a healthy digestive system</li><br/>
<li>Juices tend to be high in sugar, adding unnecessary calories to your child’s diet and frequent consumption can increase the risk of dental caries</li><br/>
<li>Too much juice can replace milk, an essential part of your preschooler’s diet. Don’t let it be a replacement for water too!
Young children need 1 ½ cups of fruit per day; so encourage your child to drink no more than 1 cup of juice per day and to enjoy a whole fruit blended with his milk for a delicious smoothie. The best option is to encourage your child to eat fresh, clean fruits along with their peel, as these are rich in vitamins and fiber.  And always remember that in order of importance of fluids to your child, water should always come first, followed by specialized growing-up milk then unsweetened juice. </li></ul></blockquote>

    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont">
    Eating sweets on a daily basis is a bad habit for children as well as grown- ups. Sweets are rich in Calories, Fats and Sugar. Overconsumption of such foods may lead to weight problems, as well as malnutrition, because your child will be eating much less of the healthier foods and will be short on essential nutrients for healthy growth. Preschoolers should be eating from all the food groups (Breads and cereals, Vegetables, Fruits, Meats and pulses, as well as Milk and Dairy) to achieve their nutritional needs for carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals. <h5>Here are some steps to encourage your child to eat healthy:</h5>
    <blockquote> <ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:normal">
<li>Start by explaining to your child how eating healthy can help him grow tall, strong and smart</li><br/>
<li>Offer your child 3 main meals and 2 snacks in between, and explain that the yummy snack will be offered in the afternoon </li><br/>
<li>Instead of offering sweets, prepare home-made snacks such as fruit salad, milk and fruit smoothie or milkshake, vegetable sticks with labneh dip, yogurt and fruit with a drizzle of honey, peanut butter sandwich, fruit-filled crepe, carrot muffin, mouhallabieh, custard and fruit)</li><br/>
<li>Always encourage your child to have a healthy breakfast: It provides the body with enough energy to start the day and prevents munching on any junk food that is easy and quick to grab</li><br/>
<li>Be a role model in your eating habits; and never miss an opportunity to gather the family around your balanced and delicious meals.

</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont">
Now that your child is in preschool, you might be wondering which specific nutrients will enhance your child’s alertness and set good grounds for school.  <h5>Here are some important pointers on what you should include in his diet:</h5>
 <blockquote> <ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:normal">
<li><strong>Iron-rich foods</strong>: Meat is one of the richest sources of iron, which is essential to the composition of human blood. If your child's diet does not contain iron, chances are that he would become tired and pale. His work, attentiveness and exercise performance could decrease. This is why you should include red meat, chicken, green leafy vegetables and legumes (lentils and beans) and Iron- fortified Milk such as specialized growing up milk on your little one’s menu. Squeezing a dash of lemon over green leafy vegetables will help the body absorb the iron that is in the leaves. This is due to the presence of vitamin C in the citrus fruit, which is also present in strawberries, oranges and kiwis.</li><br/>

<li><strong>Zinc</strong>: Make sure your child is getting enough Zinc in his diet for proper memory and brain function by offering meats, pulses, whole grains as well as Zinc-fortified growing-up milk.</li><br/>

<li><strong>B-vitamins</strong>: This group of vitamins can enhance your child’s liveliness by playing an important role in metabolism. Quite simply, it helps release energy from food into the body and brain. Foods rich in B-vitamins are whole grains, breakfast cereals, seafood, leafy green vegetables, eggs, milk, chicken and meat. So again variety is key!</li><br/>

<li><strong>Essential fatty acids</strong>: specialized growing-up milk, fish and some nuts contain important nutrients called essential fatty acids. These play a key role in the development of the brain. They are called “essential” fatty acids because the body doesn’t manufacture them, they need to be taken from food, and their presence is therefore essential in the diet.</li></ul></blockquote>

<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p>I hear a lot about Healthy Fats and their importance in brain development. How can I offer them to my 5 years old?
</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont">Essential Fatty Acids (EFAs) are a type of healthy fats and are named essential nutrients because our body and our children’s bodies cannot synthesize them and thus must be supplied by the diet, and on daily basis. <br/>
Research has shown that EFAs play an important role in brain and retinal development especially at early stages of growth (3-6 years). Not only that, but they are also important in overall growth and development. In this respect, they are one of the important nutrients that help your child to be alert, lively and quick to perceive and act.<br/>
Essential Fatty Acids are mainly found in specialized growing-up milk, vegetable oils such as corn, olive, soy bean oil, sunflower and canola oil, Fatty fish such as tuna, sardines, and salmon and some types of nuts such as walnuts. So making EFA sources a part of a healthy varied diet will help your child grow healthy and be full of life.

    <div class="acc_cont">Good nutritional habits play an important role in strengthening teeth and reducing the risk of developing dental caries. <h5>Here are tips for taking care of your child’s teeth:</h5>
    <blockquote> <ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:normal">
<li>Give him a diet rich in calcium and phosphorous: Make sure that your child gets enough Calcium and Phosphorous by serving him 3 servings of milk and dairy everyday.</li><br/>
<li>Control the quantity and quality of meals: Serve your child three balanced meals full of healthy foods, and one or two healthy snacks. Don’t allow him to skip breakfast, and for snacks limit foods that are harmful to the teeth, like sweets and sticky foods such as caramel which encourage the growth of bacteria and tooth decay, prefer fruits and vegetables instead. Prefer water over sweetened juices and carbonated beverages.</li><br/>
<li>Brush teeth regularly: Encourage your child to brush his teeth twice daily – after breakfast and before going to sleep. Use a soft toothbrush and toothpaste that contains fluoride.</li><br/>
<li>Visit the pediatric dentist regularly: The doctor will check his teeth health and show you how you should clean and care for them.</li></ul></blockquote>

    <div class="acc_cont">Every mother strives for her child to grow smart and studious. A healthy nutrition and a good daily and nightly routine will affect the way your child learns. <h5>Here are some tips to help your child become good learner in school:</h5>
      <blockquote> <ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:normal">
<li><strong>Begin with a healthy breakfast, for a healthy start every day!</strong><br/>
Breakfast makes for a successful day as it refuels the brain and body after a night of sleep, and it enhances your child’s physical and mental performance, as well as his ability to learn.  Aim for a glass of specialized growing up milk along with whole-grain cereals or a cheese sandwich and a fruit.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Pack in healthy snacks for more energy, mental activity and concentration!</strong></li>
Here are a few ideas for healthy and delicious snacks:<br/>
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;- A glass of specialized growing up milk blended with unsweetened cocoa and a banana <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- A bowl of yoghurt (plain or fruit-flavored) with 2 pieces of kaak<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Fresh and colorful fruit salad or fruit skewers<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Fresh cut vegetables served with hummus or labneh dip<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;- Whole-wheat toast topped with cheese or labneh or peanut butter <br/><br/>


<li><strong>Sweet dreams mean a better ability to learn tomorrow!</strong><br/>
A good amount of sleep at night has a positive effect on your young learner. It is associated with a better attention span and more alertness at school and thus a better ability to learn. So encourage an early school night.</li><br/>

<li><strong>A short exercise break makes studying easier!</strong><br />
Remember that performing a certain sports or exercise that your child likes can help him use some energy and take a break from his afternoon studies. This in turn will help him concentrate on his homework and enhance his ability to learn.</li></ul></blockquote>

<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p>How can I nurture the love for reading in my child?

</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont">It’s never too early to start teaching your child to read. But during the pre-school period especially, it is more important that you teach your child to love books and stories more than teaching him specifically to read. <br/><h5>These are a few steps that might help you direct your child to love reading:</h5>
     <blockquote> <ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:normal">
<li><strong>Choose books that he will be interested in that have plenty of pictures</strong>: Choose a book full of colors and nice pictures and start by telling your child what each picture means. If you are telling him a story, stop every now and then to discuss how the picture is related to the events of the story.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Bring the story to life</strong>: When you read out a story, modulate your voice with different sounds and expressions, so that your child can understand it better, and point to the words while reading.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Read what is written anywhere</strong>: Teach your child that reading is a very important part of every person’s life. If you find the sign STOP on the road, read it out loud with spelling (S, T, O, P). Read the signs on shop names, food menus or anything you see in front of you. </li><br/>
<li><strong>Lead by example</strong>: Your child wants to be like you: Hold your books and read them in front of him, don’t wait till he’s asleep to read your books.</li><br/>
<li><strong>Make reading books a wonderful experience</strong>: Don’t tell your child that he can listen to his favourite story only if he eats his food! Don’t link reading to rewards, your child may think it’s only for special times. Rather choose daily moments while you are relaxed with your child, and ready for fun and learning. It's a great way to bond with your child!</li></ul></blockquote>

    <div style="width:80%;"><p>How can I discipline my child without punishing him?

</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont">Correcting your children doesn’t have to be a negative experience. You can follow positive discipline techniques by encouraging and rewarding good behavior with lots of attention, and by ignoring tantrums, whining and other attention-seeking behavior. Your child will need you to be firm, clear and calm.  After all, if your child sees you shouting, losing your temper or hitting out, he's bound to do the same. Remember, children learn by copying you. <br/><h5>Here are some methods to follow:</h5>
<blockquote> <ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:normal">
<li><strong>Sticker charts</strong>: Make a chart with every day of the week divided into little chunks. Award a sticker for each part of the day when your child was good. Agree on a number of stickers to deserve a reward, such as a favorite film or a trip. </li><br/>
<li><strong>Time outs</strong>: Being put on a ""time out"" chair takes the child away from the actions and gives you the chance to speak to him quietly and calmly. At the end of the “time out”, give him a cuddle.  At this point, the punishment is over - don't continue telling him off. </li><br/>
<li><strong>Cause and effect</strong>: This method helps children understand the consequences of their actions. If they insist on throwing their ball over the fence, confiscate it.   </li><br/>
<li><strong>Revoke privileges</strong>: Taking away a favourite toy or video, or a privilege, such as staying up to watch a particular show, will often seem so severe to a child that they will understand how inappropriately they behaved.</li></ul></blockquote>

<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p>What sports routines can my young child start?


</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont">Playing sports at an early age offers many physical and psychological benefits, including, maintaining a healthy weight and keeping fit, having more energy, building self-esteem and social acceptance. Your preschooler is also at an age where he is interested in structured games and not just running around aimlessly, so let him choose whatever he likes best. <br/><h5>Below are some recommended and appropriate sports and their benefits to preschoolers and onwards:</h5>
    <blockquote> <ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:normal">
<li><strong>Soccer, basketball, and tennis</strong>: these sports build physical strength in your child as well as hand eye-coordination, and cardiovascular endurance. Your child will learn how to be part of a team, will acquire a sense of discipline as well as leadership qualities. </li><br/>

<li><strong>Swimming</strong>: This sport is important to teach your child how to float and not be scared of water. Then once he has mastered those basic skills he can then start to build the different swimming techniques that foster physical strength and cardiovascular endurance. </li><br/>

<li><strong>Bicycling, Trotinette and Roller blading</strong>: these sports foster balance, leg strength as well as coordination skills.  Practice them together as a family during the week or the weekend.</li><br/>

<li><strong>Ballet</strong>: As well as having the benefits of gracefulness, ballet’s benefits include better posture, and increased flexibility. And on a social note, it gives your child a sense of rhythm. </li><br/>

<li><strong>Rope jumping</strong>: This sport that kids love to play during recess focuses mostly on hand eye coordination, as well as the balance of hopping on your feet. It also helps in building and strengthening your child’s bones, as studies have shown it to increase bone mineral density.</li></ul></blockquote>

    <div style="width:80%;"><p>Why is it important for my child to play with others?


</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont">
    After their parents, children learn from their peers or friends. Playing with friends plays a major role in building your child’s character and in teaching him how to act in a social environment. <br/><h5>Here are some good reasons for allowing time for playdates:</h5>
 <blockquote> <ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:normal">
<li><strong>Teaches manners and sharing</strong>: Children need to be reminded of the rules and sharing is something many kids take a long time to acquire, but playdates speed things along since it sets the stage for your child to learn that not everything is only for him.</li><br/>

<li><strong>Builds imagination</strong>: pretend play with toys or acting like mommy or daddy makes your childs imagination run wild and keeps it open to learning as well as helping them learn more complex social ideas such as power (the teacher), wealth (a banker), compassion (a doctor), and cruelty (a thief).</li><br/>

<li><strong>Builds self-esteem</strong>: Though they're perfectly able to pick their own playmates, they still need to learn how to assert themselves and choose buddies who treat them well and make them feel good. Your child may be playing a lot with someone who never lets him take the lead, for example, so varying his playdates will teach him how to deal with the different types of children he will meet. 
</li><br/>
<li><strong>Builds communication skills</strong>: children don’t just play side by side after the age of 3; they are now interacting with other kids building their language skills, and their vocabulary. Don’t be surprised if your child repeats a word he shouldn’t be saying; he probably heard it from one of his friends. </li></ul></blockquote>

Remember that friends actively influence the thinking and behavior of your child at this age, so your guidance is always needed!
