<h2>Frequently Asking Questions</h2>
<span style="color:#666">
The big questions<br />
Becoming a mum is an important step. There are several “big questions” that may be running through your mind. Just remember, having a baby is the most wonderful thing in the world!
</span>
<br />
<div class="quest" id="faq">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p> Am I ready?</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span> Have you always wanted to have a child? You've found the perfect father? Then you are ready to launch into the adventure of motherhood. However, if you are still rationally weighing up the pros and cons, it is best if you wait a little while longer until you are really mature and sure of your choice.</span>
</div>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p>Will my baby be normal?
</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span> All women ask themselves this. The medical supervision of pregnancy in itself can be a source of anxiety. It is important to talk about this with your partner and the doctor looking after you during your pregnancy. He will be able to inform, reassure and advise you.</span>
</div>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p>Why am I worried about giving birth?
</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span> The closer the due date, the greater the worry. The fear of not being up to the task and, sometimes, apprehension about meeting this unknown child are perfectly legitimate.<br />

Remind yourself that if women have been giving birth since the dawn of time, there is no reason that you won’t manage. Giving birth is the most natural thing in the world.</span>

</div>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p>Does parenting come naturally?
</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span> It’s not always easy being a parent, and looking after a child can sometimes be challenge.  There is no magic formula for successfully raising a child, and perfect parents don’t exist either. So don’t stress unduly.<br />
Raising a child is above all about helping them to grow up, and all that them needs for this is your support and a listening ear.</span>

</div>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p>Will I love my baby?

</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span> Maternal instinct doesn't always come naturally. Many mothers admit to not having felt this unconditional love towards their newborn child in the days following its birth. Yet, a mother’s love is powerful and very quickly takes root indelibly, never to leave.</span>
</div>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p>Do I need to eat twice as much as before now that I’m pregnant?

</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span> Although you’re eating for another person you don’t necessarily need to eat twice as much. It’s more a question of what you eat which is key during pregnancy. You will of course find that you will want to eat more food, but the best is to follow a healthy and balanced diet, one that offers you and your baby the optimal nutrition during pregnancy. Visit the Pregnancy & Birth section for advice on how and what to eat for the both of you!.</span>

</div>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p> I’ve never heard of most of the vitamins and minerals! Am I getting enough of them? 


</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span> Don’t worry, although you might not have heard of many of these vitamins and minerals you most certainly eat them without knowing. They are found in all foods we eat, but will be more abundant in some rather than in others. During pregnancy you have increased requirements for certain vitamins and minerals and you should get these by eating the right foods. If you are not sure, then you may consider nutritional supplements as a means to top up your diet, but speak to your healthcare professional for advice first.</span>

</div>
</div>

<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p> What does folic acid do? 


</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span> Folic acid is actually a vitamin and has been shown to have many beneficial effects for your baby. Studies have shown that folic acid taken in the 12 weeks before falling pregnant and during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy can reduce the risks of your baby having neural tube defects.</span>

</div>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p>I’m not sure I’m getting the nutrients I need, what should I do? 


</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span> The first thing is to try and eat a healthy balanced diet. It is best to incorporate foods from all the essential food groups that include grains, vegetables, fruits, milk and dairy, meat and beans as well as small amounts of healthy fats (oils). Visit the birth and pregnancy section for more on eating healthy during pregnancy. If this might be a challenge to you, talk to your doctor for advice, there are nutritional supplements that can help boost your diet to reach the levels of nutrients required.</span>

<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p>Why are pregnant women advised to take a prenatal vitamin and mineral supplement? 


</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span> Although everyone agrees you should turn to nutritious foods first to meet your vitamin and mineral needs, the reality is that many women’s diets fall short of the ideal. A prenatal vitamin supplement can fill in the nutritional gaps on those days when you don’t eat quite right. The secret is to supplement sensibly. A multiple-vitamin-and-mineral supplement that supplies about 100% of the Recommended Dietary Allowances for each nutrient (as listed on the label) is sufficient for most adults. However, during pregnancy, iron, calcium, and folic acid are required at higher levels. Therefore, your doctor may recommend a prenatal vitamin and mineral supplement to help meet your needs. Pregnancy isn’t the time to experiment with large doses of single nutrients, since megadoses of some of them—such as vitamin A, vitamin D, selenium, and fluoride—can produce numerous side effects in your baby, ranging from mottled teeth to birth defects. Always consult your doctor before taking any prenatal vitamin and mineral supplement during pregnancy.</span>

<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p>Are artificial sweeteners harmful to my baby?


</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span> Artificial sweeteners have had a lot of bad press. That’s not to say that soft drinks are nutritionally equivalent to fruit juice, because nothing could be further from the truth. However, there’s no evidence that artificial sweeteners, such as aspartame (sold under the Equal® or NutraSweet® brand names), used in moderation are harmful to pregnant women or a baby in the womb. If you are still in doubt, it is best to leave them out!</span>

</div>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p>Are there some foods I should avoid eating while I'm pregnant?


</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span> Yes, there are certain things you need to be aware of when it comes to eating. For starters, possible environmental toxins make eating raw seafood a potential risk to a foetus. Therefore, eliminate uncooked clams, oysters, sushi, and sashimi from your diet. Raw or undercooked meat, poultry and eggs can also carry food-borne bacteria, which means that you should steer clear of rare hamburgers and steaks, homemade mayonnaise, and Caesar salad (the dressing can contain undercooked egg). Additionally, soft cheeses can be an issue, so steer clear of Brie, Camembert and similar soft cheeses. Since you shouldn’t eat too much vitamin A during pregnancy, avoid liver and liver based products such as pate. And to be on the safe side, avoid herbal teas and any other herbal home remedies. Their effect on pregnancy is not well documented. Discover more in our Pregnancy section.</span>

<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p> Sometimes I feel like I can't catch my breath. Is this normal?


</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span> Yes! That big, blooming baby of yours is crowding your diaphragm and even your lungs, making you feel short of breath. The feeling will go away when the baby engages in the pelvis (lightening). In the meantime, maintain good posture so your lungs have some room to expand. Be assured your baby is getting enough oxygen.</span>

<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p>I'm only in my eighth month, but sometimes I feel uterine contractions. Is that possible?


</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span> Yes, it's not only possible, but also expected. What you are probably feeling are Braxton Hicks contractions, which many women experience in their last trimester. Each lasts about 30 seconds. These are not labour pains, but they seem to serve the purpose of "exercising" the uterus so it is toned up and ready to work hard when the big day arrives. They are also the contractions responsible for "false" labour.</span>

</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span>The last month of your pregnancy isn't the best time to travel far from home. One practical consideration is that you may go into labour when you're miles away from your doctor and hospital. If you feel you must travel, consult with your doctor and get a note verifying that it's safe for you to fly. Many airlines won’t let you board without such a note.

<hr />
<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p>I read somewhere that you shouldn't sleep on your back while pregnant because it can harm the baby. Is this true?


</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span> When you lie on your back during the last half of pregnancy your enlarged uterus can compress two main blood vessels against your spine. The result: decreased blood flow to either you or the baby. Think of it as a garden hose that gets a kink in it. For these reasons, women should not lie on their backs after their 20th week. You'll probably find that you won't want to lie flat on your back anyway, because when blood flow is compromised you can experience symptoms such as difficulty breathing, nausea and faintness. Lying on your left side is the most ideal position, because it keeps your major blood vessels from being compressed, and allows good circulation. If lying on your back is the most comfortable position for you, prop yourself up with a few pillows so you’re in a semi-upright position.</span>

<hr />
<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p>I have very small breasts. Will I still be able to breastfeed?


</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span>There should be no problem with breastfeeding your baby. The size and shape of your breasts has nothing to do with the quality and quantity of milk you’ll produce. Small breasts do not produce less milk than large breasts do. Your level of milk production will increase in direct proportion to the amount of sucking baby does.</span>

</div>
</div>
<hr />
<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p>My breasts are swollen and it's painful to breastfeed. What can I do?


</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span>Your midwife, doctor or nurse will refer to this condition as “engorgement”. When breastmilk first "comes in," many mothers experience mild to moderate engorgement. The swelling occurs because your breastmilk production isn’t synchronized with your baby’s intake as yet. In time, your breasts will produce breastmilk in response to your baby’s need. Another reason your breasts may be swollen is because you’re not feeding often enough or you’re feeding inconsistently. Here are some helpful tips to alleviate engorgement: Before breastfeeding, apply very warm moist heat packs to your breasts for 10 minutes or take a hot shower allowing the water to splash onto your breasts. Some mums find taking a hot bath very helpful because it’s relaxing and eases tension. Massage your breasts for several minutes. Then hand express or pump breastmilk for a couple of minutes on each breast to soften the areola. This will help your baby "latch-on." After feeding, apply cold packs to help decrease engorgement and keep it under control. Breastfeed consistently every 2 to 3 hours to help synchronize your milk production to your baby’s intake. </span>

<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p>What should I do before I get pregnant to ensure a healthy pregnancy for me and my baby?


</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span> Many women may not give importance to their nutrition before pregnancy and may not get all that they need of the different nutrients essential for the demands of pregnancy; that is why becoming healthy before becoming pregnant is very important.<br />

Pre-conception nutrition is a vital part of preparing for your pregnancy. Factors such as your weight compared to your height and what you eat can play an important role in your health during pregnancy and the health of your developing fetus.<br />
<h5>
Pre-pregnancy weight</h5>

Pre-pregnancy weight has a direct influence on your baby’s birth weight. Studies show that underweight women are more likely to give birth to small babies, even though they might gain the same weight when they are pregnant as normal weighed women!<br />

Overweight women before pregnancy can have increased risks or complications in pregnancy such as gestational diabetes or high blood pressure.<br />

So, it is recommended that you reach your healthy weight (either gain or lose weight) before you get pregnant. For those who are underweight, consume more calories that your body needs especially from healthy sources like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, milk and meat. If you are overweight, you will need to cut off extra calories especially those that come from fats and low nutrition foods (junk food and sweets).<br />

Well-balanced diet<br />

If you are planning to have a baby, you need to follow a healthy balanced diet. It is best to incorporate foods from all the essential food groups that include grains, vegetables, fruits, milk and dairy, meat and beans as well as small amounts of healthy fats (oils).
<br />
Tips for pre-pregnancy nutrition and lifestyle factors:<blockquote>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:normal">

<li> Increase your intake of fruits and vegetables as these are rich in many vitamins and minerals that you need for a healthy body</li>
<li> Eat three servings of low-fat milk or dairy products to help build a healthy body when you are pregnant</li>
<li>Whole grains give you the energy and nutrients you will need</li>
<li>Avoid fast foods, sodas and reduce your sweet intake as well as they are low in nutrition and high in calories and fat</li>
<li>Drink as much water as possible; it should be your favorite drink during this period</li>
<li>Light to moderate exercise is good for your body. Although, when you get pregnant, you should consult with your doctor if it is safe to continue</li>
<li>Consult with your doctor before getting pregnant about folic acid tablets as folic acid is very important in preventing many birth defects. A good mix of green leafy vegetables will also boost your intake</li>
<li>Stop bad habits like smoking</li>
<li>Minimize stress if and whenever possible.</li>
</ul> </blockquote></span>

<hr />
<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p>I hear that a pregnant woman can continue exercising. What are the best exercises during pregnancy?


</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont">Exercise has become a vital part of many women's lives. However, theoretic concerns have been raised about the safety of some forms of exercise during pregnancy.<br />

To begin with, you should consult your doctor before starting any physical activity.<br />

Then, you should take into consideration whether you were already active before getting pregnant.<blockquote>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:normal">
<li>In case you were following a regular exercise programme prior to your pregnancy, you should be able to maintain that programme to some degree throughout your pregnancy. Sometimes, it's better to gradually decrease the intensity from vigorous to moderate to light. Just listen to your body since it will give you signals if it's time to reduce the level of exercise you perform.</li>
<li> In case you are just starting an exercise programme as a way of improving your health during your pregnancy, you should start very slowly and be careful not to over-exert yourself. In fact, moderate physical activity is considered to be beneficial for most pregnant women and their babies.
</li></ul>
</blockquote>

What are the benefits of Exercise during Pregnancy?<br />

In general, exercise helps you feel better physically and emotionally. For pregnant women in particular, regular, moderate exercise can help:<blockquote><ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:normal">
<li> Relieve stress</li>
<li>Prevent constipation</li>
<li>Prevent varicose veins</li>
<li>Prevent and control gestational diabetes</li>
<li> Relieve backache</li>
<li> Prepare your body for childbirth (build the stamina needed for labour and delivery)</li>
<li> Maintain your overall physical fitness and prevents excessive weight gain</li></ul> </blockquote>
<h5>
What is a moderate exercise program?</h5>

Pregnant women should be able to maintain their breathing well and carry on a normal conversation during physical activities. Examples of moderate and acceptable activities during pregnancy: Walking, Swimming, Light Dance, Exercise classes for pregnant women and Relaxation/stretching.
<br />
Good to Remember:
<br />
Yoga during pregnancy can help you learn to breathe deeply and relax, which will come in handy as you face the physical demands of labour, birth, and motherhood. It is good to know that there are specific yoga classes for pregnant women.
<br />
Be Careful!<blockquote>
<ul style="line-height:normal;list-style-type:disc">
<li>Never exercise to the point of exhaustion or breathlessness. This is a sign that your baby and your body cannot get the oxygen supply it needs.</li><li> Overheating should be avoided since elevated core body temperatures can harm the developing fetus.</li>
<li>Pregnant women should refrain from exercise that involves the risk of abdominal trauma, falls or excessive joint stress, as in skiing, horseback riding and contact sports (such as football).</li>
<li>Pregnant women are more prone to injury of the ligaments. Jumping or bouncing types of exercise should not be performed.</li>
<li>After 20 weeks, pregnant women should avoid exercise while lying flat on the back. This can restrict blood flow to the fetus.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
Example of a weekly exercise programme: 
<br /><br />
<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10px;" border="1" align="center" width="80%">
  <tr>
    <td style="padding-left:20px;" ><li style="list-style-type:disc">  Sunday: Walking for 30 minutes</li> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="padding-left:20px;"> <li style="list-style-type:disc">Monday: Swimming</li> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="padding-left:20px;"><li style="list-style-type:disc"> Tuesday: Yoga or special classes for pregnant women</li> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="padding-left:20px;" ><li style="list-style-type:disc"> Wednesday: Walking for 30 minutes</li> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="padding-left:20px;"><li style="list-style-type:disc"> Thursday: Swimming</li> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="padding-left:20px;"><li style="list-style-type:disc"> Friday: Walking for 30 minutes</li> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="padding-left:20px;"><li style="list-style-type:disc"> Saturday: Keep up a healthy active lifestyle through normal daily activities like shopping, walking in the park with your  family, etc.</li> </td>
  </tr>
</table>

  <br />


Pay attention to your body and how you feel. Don’t overdo it -- try to build up your level of fitness gradually. Despite the benefits of physical activity, it's important to check with your healthcare provider before you begin or proceed with your exercise programme.

<div class="quest">
    <div style="width:80%;"><p>How much weight should I gain during my pregnancy? 


</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span> Many women during their pregnancy will always be asked how much weight they have gained. Moderate weight gain during pregnancy is normal as your baby’s growth and development will depend on it. The extra kilograms will eventually be lost after delivery to reach your pre-pregnancy weight after some time.<br />

You as a pregnant woman can gain an average of 12 kg (8-16 kg) to account for the baby’s weight and other tissues and fluids accompanying pregnancy. You should neither worry about that nor lower your caloric intake unless there is pre-pregnancy obesity or a high weight gain.
<br />
Here’s where the weight gain goes<blockquote>
<ul style="line-height:normal;list-style-type:disc">
<li> Baby: 2 – 3.4 kg</li>
<li> Placenta: 0.5 kg</li>
<li>Amniotic fluid: 4.0 – 5.9 kg</li>
<li>Larger uterus: 0.5 – 1.1 kg</li>

Good to know<br />

Did you know that it is not true when people say you should eat for 2 during pregnancy? The average increase in your calorie intake should not exceed 300 calories per day and that is after your first trimester!<br />

The pattern of you to gain weight is as follows:<blockquote>
<ul style="line-height:normal;list-style-type:disc"><li>In the first trimester, you do not need to gain much weight, only about 0-2 kg</li>
<li>In the second and third trimester, steady weight gain is important for baby’s growth and development, which can be about 1–2 kg/month
</li></ul>
</blockquote>
As a result it’s preferred that your weight gain doesn’t exceed these limits as it would lead to several complications in pregnancy and delivery. Some of them could be high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, fatigue, backache, delivery complications due to increased fetus weight and less milk secretion due to the high storage of fat tissues around the milk glands. Another point pregnant women should not forget is that when they gain excess weight, they will find it difficult to get back to their pre-pregnancy weight.<br />

Here are a few tips to follow to control your weight gain during pregnancy:<blockquote>
<ul style="line-height:normal;list-style-type:disc">
<li> Eat small, frequent meals distributed throughout the day; breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner</li>
<li> Increase your fluid intake, especially of water</li>
<li> Eat more fruits and vegetables, which increases the feeling of fullness yet are relatively low in calories with no fat</li>
<li> Reduce to a minimum your intake of fried and sweet foods</li>
<li> Try to cut down on junk and fast foods as they are high-calorie foods with no nutritional benefits for you or your baby</li>
<li> Consume good quality proteins beneficial for building cells and tissues, like meats (all kinds), eggs, dairy products and legumes</li>
<li> Increase your intake of high-calcium foods like milk and dairy products. These are not only rich in calcium but are high in proteins</li>
<li> Do not always give in to you increased appetite especially if your food intake has increased remarkably, because this will put you at a higher risk of pregnancy complications</li>
</ul>

</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span>Taking care of your health and eating the right foods during pregnancy would result in a smooth pregnancy and lessen its undesirable side-effects.<br />

During the first trimester, pregnancy hormones start to elevate in your blood and your body will start to change gradually. These changes in your hormones will cause you some disagreeable symptoms which may appear strong and undesirable in some women, while none in others.<br />

Some of these symptoms are:<br /><blockquote><ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:normal">
<li> Nausea and Vomiting: Often occurring during the first trimester and called morning sickness, because it mostly happens during the first few hours of the morning while the stomach is empty but it can also happen at any time during the day. You can reduce this feeling of nausea by changing some of your eating habits:<ul style="line-height:normal;list-style-type:disc">
<li> Do not drink liquids in the early morning or with meals</li>
<li> Keep at the side of your bed some crackers, plain biscuits or kaak so you can have some before you get out of bed</li>
<li> Take 6 small, frequent meals instead of 3 large ones that can make you feel uncomfortable</li>
<li> Avoid high fat and fried foods</li>
<li> Avoid strong odours of food and perfumes</li>
<li>Avoid smoking environments </li></ul></blockquote>

And always remember to compensate water lost during vomiting by drinking enough of it and other liquids between meals.<blockquote>
<ul style="line-height:normal;list-style-type:disc">
<li> Heartburn: This can be attributed to the uterus' enlargement adding more pressure on the intestines and the stomach which causes some of its acids to go back through your esophagus, thus making you get heartburn. Heartburn can be reduced by eating slowly in a comfortable and relaxed environment and also by increasing the frequency of your meals and decreasing the quantity on each meal. It is best to avoid foods that might increase your heartburn like spicy and high fat foods.</li></ul> </blockquote>
Other recommendations include light walking, not lying down directly after a meal and wearing light and comfortable clothes.<br />

The best way is to watch your diet especially if you have some of the previously mentioned side effects of pregnancy:<blockquote>
<ul style="line-height:normal;list-style-type:disc">
<li> Balance your food from the essential food groups: fruits, vegetables, milk and dairy products, meat and legumes, whole grains and healthy fats in moderation</li>
<li> Minimize intake of high-fat and fried foods which increase undesirable symptoms</li>
<li> Drink plenty of water to maintain your overall health and skin health</li>
<li> Avoid stress and anxiety which might worsen the symptoms</li>
<li> Always consult your doctor so that he is aware of any side effect you may have and advise you accordingly</li></ul> </blockquote></blockquote>

    <div style="width:80%;"><p>I am having cravings. Is that normal?



</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span> It’s 3am and you’re awake. All you can think of is that tub of chocolate ice cream in your refrigerator. Or is it that packet of chips? Or both!<blockquote>
This may seem odd to most, but is a familiar feeling for mums-to-be. Statistics say, more than 3/4 of all women experience food cravings at some point in their pregnancy, usually in the first trimester!<br />

The most commonly reported cravings are for sweets (chocolate, cake, Arabic sweets), dairy products (especially cheese and labneh) and salty foods (chips, crackers, salted nuts, etc), and often in peculiar combinations such as a spoon of labneh with a slice of chocolate cake, sugar sprinkled on cucumber pickles... etc. Not surprisingly, many women prefer to keep their cravings to themselves, rather than report them!</blockquote>

Yet this is not unusual and quite natural, say experts. But what causes perfectly normal, calorie-conscious women to suddenly give into these culinary cravings?

Is it physiological?
<blockquote>
Experts believe that cravings are a result of the body's dramatically changing hormones. The hormonal factor is compounded by a pregnant women's more acute sense of taste and smell which drive her away from some foods and compel her, hysterically, to another!
</blockquote>
Is it nutritional?
<blockquote>
Another popular theory is that the craving may be nutritionally based. For instance, craving salty foods may be because your body needs more sodium as your blood volume increases. Or in case of fluid shortage, your body will try and compensate by craving for salty foods which when eaten will increase your thirst and desire for water. Conversely, Sweet cravings might indicate low blood sugar or fatigue.
</blockquote>
Should you give in to your cravings?
<blockquote>
Yes! At least some of the time. And since these cravings usually stop by the end of the first trimester, we suggest you give in to them wisely, especially if it’ll make you happier! But bear in mind that consuming large quantities of the food you crave for, whether sweet or salty, might lead to unwanted problems such as hypertension and gestational diabetes, especially in the second and third trimester.
</blockquote>
So, how should you handle salt and sweet cravings?<blockquote><ul style="line-height:normal;list-style-type:disc">
<li> Start your day right with a good breakfast. Make sure your breakfast contains sufficient complex carbohydrates to prevent hunger-triggered cravings later in the day. For example: 2 slices of whole wheat toast with 2 tablespoons of labneh or a bowl of low-fat milk and whole-wheat breakfast cereals.</li>
<li> Eat your meals at regular intervals. Ideally 3 healthy meals and 2 snacks. This will keep your blood sugar levels stable.</li>

<br />
<ul style="line-height:normal;list-style-type:disc">
<li> Try to counteract your salt craving with something sour. So try low fat yogurt or labneh with a pinch of sumac or fresh salad with extra lemon juice. Alternatively cut cucumbers, carrots and tomatoes and combine it with labneh dip, or go for a yogurt and cucumber salad with a pinch of dried mint.</li>
<li> Limit your portions, if you cannot resist. Have a small packet of baked chips instead of family pack! Or a thin slice of your favourite chocolate cake, instead of a chunky piece.</li></ul>
Whatever you do, remember that the food craving is common in pregnant women and can be indulged in, as long as you do it wisely. Also bear in mind that there are nutritious choices for just about every food you crave for – from salt to sweet, starchy to crunchy, hot or cold. And with little creativity and some willpower you may often be able to find wholesome substitutes that truly satisfy both body and soul. Do it frequently and you may be surprised to find your cravings being regulated!

    <div style="width:80%;"><p>How can I prevent constipation and other symptoms that occur in the last months of pregnancy?</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span>You’re well on your way through the last stretch of your pregnancy. This is your third and final trimester where you start preparing for your delivery and looking forward to seeing your little bundle of joy! <br />
	Together with the feelings of anticipation and delight, some of you may experience several symptoms towards the end of your pregnancy, especially now that your baby is bigger and your pregnancy bulge is easily obvious.<br />
	So, to help you through this stage, here are some helpful tips on what you might experience and how to ensure that you are as comfortable as possible:<br /><br />

	<strong>Heartburn:</strong> <br />

	This is due to the pressure of your enlarged uterus on the stomach which can cause some of the stomach acids to go back to your esophagus. To prevent heartburn, avoid having an empty stomach for long periods, and when you eat, try not to eat till you feel full. Instead, have light nutritious meals every 3 hours and avoid foods that are more likely to make you feel heartburn such as fried and high-fat foods and spicy food. Since you are more likely to encounter heart burn at night, have an early light dinner and try to sleep with your head elevated.<br /><br />

	<strong>Bloating and swelling of hands and feet:</strong> <br />

	This is mostly caused by water retention. So increase your intake of fluids especially water and reduce your sodium intake from salt in canned foods, ketchup, sauces, pickles and chips. Other recommendations include performing some light activity such as walking to get rid of excess retained water and keep your blood pumping the right way.<br /><br />

	<strong>Constipation:</strong> <br />

	This is mostly caused by changes in your hormone levels, less activity and a low intake of fiber. In order to prevent constipation, eat fiber-rich foods such as vegetables, fresh or dried fruits, whole grains and legumes. Remember that fiber absorbs water from your gastro-intestinal tract, so drink more water and fluids!<br /><br />	

	<strong>Tiredness and sleepiness:</strong><br />

	At this stage you are more prone to develop anemia with all its uncomfortable symptoms. This could be due to the enlarged blood volume and inadequate nutrition during the previous months. That’s why you need to eat more meat and chicken, in addition to vegetarian sources rich in iron like lentils, beans, chickpeas and green leafy vegetables (spinach, parsley). Don’t forget to include a vitamin C source (lemon, orange, melon, broccoli, green pepper) in your meal, in order to increase the absorption of iron from legumes and vegetables.<br /><br />

	Another important point to remember is to keep taking the vitamin and mineral pills prescribed by your doctor, especially iron supplements if recommended.<br />

	In conclusion, remember that this is the trimester where you might start feeling heavier. Your weight will most probably increase between 1 ½ and 2 kg this month, so don’t forget to keep moving to avoid excess weight gain and some of the symptoms mentioned above. However, most importantly, eat healthy and right, because your baby will gain the most weight during this period. This will ensure that your little miracle will be healthy in size and weight when you hold him within your loving arms.</span>

</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span>Your body experiences many changes during pregnancy, and now after delivery, your goal is to regain your pre-pregnancy weight and maintain it. And to achieve your goal, you are ready to go on any strict diet! But be patient and consult your doctor about the right time to start following a diet and the right diet for you.<br />

Hormonal changes: its effect on your weight<br />

Pregnancy is a physiological phase that’s accompanied by temporary changes in women’s bodies; the most important of which is weight gain. Can women regain their figure or is the weight increase going to be a problem?<blockquote><ul style="line-height:normal;list-style-type:disc">
<li>During pregnancy: weight gain is experienced due to hormonal changes especially in estrogen and progesterone, which can result in water retention, in addition to the weight of the placenta, the baby and the amniotic fluid.</li>
<li> Post-delivery (immediately): anticipate that your weight will decrease approximately by half because of the delivery of your baby as well as the elimination of the placenta and amniotic fluid. Pregnancy hormone levels will decrease, so their effect on water retention will gradually be reduced and this further reduces your weight.</li>
<li> Post-delivery phase: following a regular moderate exercise plan and a balanced diet will help you reduce your weight.</li></ul></blockquote>

Does weight loss affect milk production for breastfeeding?<blockquote>

Experts warn that following a strict low-calorie diet can lower milk production by 15%, and in some cases, lowering the calorie further can cause the milk to stop. So, consult a dietitian to guide you to the right way for weight loss without affecting your milk flow.</blockquote>
Does breastfeeding accelerate weight loss?<blockquote>
Studies show that breastfeeding can help you get to your pre-pregnancy weight gradually, and it causes your uterus to shrink to its original size.
<br />
Breastfeeding for more than three months speeds up your weight loss and helps you lose the body fat gained during pregnancy. But this doesn’t mean that you can overeat.<br /><br />

</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span> Are you thinking twice about drinking coffee because you are pregnant? With increased attention drawn to nutrition and health, many women wonder if it is safe to consume products that contain caffeine during pregnancy.<br />

Women can now put their minds to rest as recent research supports moderate consumption of caffeine for women in general, including pregnant women.
<br />
What does research say about coffee and a pregnant women’s health?<blockquote>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:normal">
<li>Coffee and fertility:Although a few earlier studies suggested that consumption of caffeine could delay conception, recent scientific research indicates that moderate consumption has no effect on the ability to conceive. Delayed conception could be due to other factors such as excessive exercise, stress or other dietary habits.</li>
<li> Coffee and morning sickness:Morning sickness is a common experience during early pregnancy. During a normal pregnancy, hormone levels are high thus increasing the likelihood of nausea. Therefore, some nauseated pregnant women may not desire certain foods and beverages including those that contain caffeine! Doctors usually advise pregnant women who experience nausea to consume bland foods and beverages such as crackers and water.</li>
<li>Coffee and breastfeeding:Women should also take note of what they eat while breastfeeding to ensure healthy milk production. Limited caffeine consumption has no effect on breastfeeding as the amount of caffeine passed to the infant through breast milk is minimal and will not affect the baby. However, large amounts of caffeine may lead to increased wakefulness and poor feeding for the baby. Therefore, it is best to take coffee in moderation.</ul></blockquote>
How much coffee can you drink during pregnancy?<blockquote><ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:normal">

<li> It is solely based on you as an individual and varies from one person to another. For any clarifications, you can check with your doctor.</li>
<li> The general nutrition recommendation is to consume coffee in moderation and that’s equivalent to two cups of coffee per day.</li>
If you are a big coffee drinker, here’s what you should do:<br />
<li> Gradually decrease the number of cups you drink per day</li>
</li>Try to replace some of your coffee with decaffeinated coffee. A good idea would be to put half of the quantity of coffee in your cup as decaf and the other half as normal coffee</li>
<li> Do not exceed 2 cups of coffee during your pregnancy, and if you want more, you should opt for decaffeinated coffee.</li></ul></blockquote>

    <div style="width:80%;"><p> I am breastfeeding my baby. What can I eat to offer my baby the best nutrition?


</p></div>
    <div class="more_btn">More</div>
    <div class="acc_cont"><span> Congratulations on the birth of your baby! Breastfeeding is important not only for your baby but for you as well! Breast milk is the perfect milk for your baby as it covers all his nutritional needs for the first 6 months of life as well as provides him with immunity factors.<br />

As the mother, you will also benefit from this natural phenomena; it will help you get rid of the fat tissues that were stored during pregnancy by using this fat as a source of energy to produce milk. Your body will not only store fat during pregnancy to use in breastfeeding, but will also store other important nutrients such as proteins which are important for milk production and quality. That’s why it is so important to get a varied, healthy balanced diet during both pregnancy and breastfeeding in order to get all the needed nutrients.<br />

Some nutrients’ needs during breastfeeding are increased mainly to account for milk production. They are:
<blockquote><ul style="list-style-type:disc;line-height:normal">

<li> Calories: Increased by 500 kcal/day of your normal needs</li>
<li>Protein: Increased by 15gm/day of your normal needs and this translates to two additional servings of meat, legumes, dairy products or eggs</li>
<li> Vitamin A: Your needs reach to 1200-1300 micrograms/day due to its high secretion in the milk. Its sources are green leafy vegetables and yellowish fruits and vegetables, also found in the kidneys and liver</li>
<li>Vitamin C: Might reach to 90 milligrams/day due to its high secretion in milk. Rich sources are citrus fruits, mango, melon, strawberries and green peppers</li>
<li>Calcium and Phosphorous: Multiple pregnancies and lactation would lead to extra amounts of these nutrients needed by the body in order to maintain healthy bones. 1200 milligrams/day is the daily requirement and the best sources are milk and all dairy products</li></ul></blockquote>
Therefore, a healthy diet is quite important for breastfeeding women as it helps maintain a healthy milk production and composition as well as keeps her body healthy. Low intake of food or going on crash diets during the breastfeeding period can lead to many health complications such as osteoporosis (later in life) and low stores of vitamin A in the body.<br />

So, if you need advice on diet, consult a dietician to give you a personalized diet that takes into consideration your nutritional needs.<br />

Good to know<br />

Did you know that breastfeeding your baby will help you lose those extra kilograms you gained during pregnancy?<br />

Breastfeeding nutrition tips for mothers:
<blockquote><ul style="line-height:normal;list-style-type:disc">
<li> Consume soups, juices and a minimum of 8 glasses of water daily as they are high in fluids and will facilitate milk production and compensate the loss of fluids from the body<br />
</li>Eat a lot of fruits and vegetables which are a good source of vitamins, minerals and fibre which your body needs during this phase</li>
<li> Add high quality protein in your diet like meat, fish and eggs</li>
</li>Avoid fried and sweet foods as they are low in nutrients and don’t increase milk secretion</li>
</li>Consume 3 servings of milk and dairy products daily which are good source of protein, calcium and phosphorous</li>
</li>Eat nuts (almonds, walnuts, etc) in moderation; these are known to be beneficial for women who are breastfeeding as they are full of nutrients but also high in oils and calories</li>
</li>Avoid foods that might cause discomfort for your baby like cauliflower, broccoli, legumes and spicy foods</li>
</li>Avoid smoking and alcohol for their negative effect on milk production</li>
<li> Perform light physical activity after your doctor’s approval</li></ul></blockquote></span>
